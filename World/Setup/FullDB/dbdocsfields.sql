Due to technical reasons in how targetting is handled, the eventAI script cannot target anything or anyone that is not in its threat list or is not the scripted creature itself. It also can\'t currently target anyone specific in its threat list except by their position in the threat list. However, even then it can only target specifically the current victim, the second unit in its threat list, and the last unit in its threat list. It can also target units in its threat list at random and has two options for that: anyone in its threat list at random, or anyone in its threat list excluding the unit with the most threat. Aside from all of those external targets, the script can always target itself. More information on the target types can be found in the reference tables at the end of this guide.<br /><br />One last note before we start looking at individual actions is about the texts. The eventAI script has support for localized text entries. Therefore, you can define what the mob will say in more than one language all in another table and the script will show the corresponding localized text to the corresponding client (english text to enUS/enGB clients, german text to deDE clients, etc). All of the localized text entries will have a unique text ID assigned to them and it is that text ID that will be used by any actions that require textual input.<br /><br />¬subtable:2¬'),

(144,0,'creature_loot_template','groupid','A group is a set of loot definitions.','A group is a set of loot definitions processed in such a way that at any given looting event the loot generated can receive only 1 (or none) item from the items declared in the loot definitions of the group. Groups are formed by loot definitions having the same values of entry and groupid fields. \r\n\r\nA group may consists of explicitly-chanced (having non-zero ChanceOrQuestChance) and equal-chanced (ChanceOrQuestChance = 0) entries. Every equal-chanced entry of a group is considered having such a chance that: \r\n\r\n¦all equal-chanced entries have the same chance \r\n¦group chance (sum of chances of all entries) is 100% \r\nOf course group may consist of \r\n\r\n¦only explicitly-chanced entries or \r\n¦only equal-chanced entries or \r\n¦entries of both type. \r\nThe easies way to understand what are groups is to understand how core processes grouped entries: \r\n\r\nAt loading time: \r\n\r\n¦groups are formed - all grouped entries with the same values of groupid and entry fields are gathered into two sets - one for explicitly-chanced entries and one for equal-chanced. Note that order of entries in the sets can not be defined by DB - you should assume that the entries are in an unknown order. But indeed every time core processes a group the entries are in some order, constant during processing. \r\nDuring loot generation: \r\n\r\n¦core rolls for explicitly-chanced entries (if any): \r\n¦a random number R is rolled in range 0 to 100 (floating point value). \r\n¦chance to drop is checked for every (explicitly-chanced) entry in the group: \r\n¦if R is less than absolute value of ChanceOrQuestChance of the entry then the entry \'wins\': the item is included in the loot. Group processing stops, the rest of group entries are just skipped. \r\n¦otherwise the entry \'looses\': the item misses its chance to get into the loot. R is decreased by the absolute value of ChanceOrQuestChance and next explicitly-chanced entry is checked. \r\n¦if none of explicitly-chanced entries got its chance then equal-chanced part (if any) is processed: \r\n¦a random entry is selected from the set of equal-chanced entries and corresponding item is included in the loot. \r\n¦If nothing selected yet (this never happens if the group has some equal-chanced entries) - no item from the group is included into the loot. \r\nLet us use term group chance as the sum of ChanceOrQuestChance (absolute) values for the group. Please note that even one equal-chanced entry makes group chance to be 100% (provided that sum of explicit chances does not exceed 100%). \r\n\r\nIf you understand the process you can understand the results: \r\n\r\n¦Not more than one item from a group may drop at any given time. \r\n¦If group chance is at least 100 then one item will be dropped for sure. \r\n¦If group chance does not exceed 100 then every item defined in group entries has exactly that chance to drop as set in ChanceOrQuestChance. \r\n¦If group chance is greater than 100 then some entries will lost a part of their chance (or even not be checked at all - that will be the case for all equal-chanced entries) whatever value takes the roll R. So for some items chance to drop will be less than their ChanceOrQuestChance. That is very bad and that is why having group chance > 100 is strictly prohibited. \r\n¦Processing of equal-chanced part takes much less time then of explicitly-chanced one. So usage of equal-chanced groups is recommended when possible. \r\nSo now basic applications of the groups are clear: \r\n\r\n¦Groups with group chance of 100% generate exactly one item every time. This is needed quite often, for example such behavior is needed to define a loot template for tier item drop from a boss. \r\n¦Groups with group chance < 100 generate one or zero items every time keeping chances of every item unchanged. Such behavior is useful to limit maximum number of items in the loot. \r\n¦A single group may be defined for a set of items common for several loot sources. This could be very useful for decreasing DB size without any loss of data. See References for more details. \r\nThere is no way to have a reference as a part of a group. \r\n\r\nNote: A group may contain definitions of non-quest drop, quest drop or both, but mixing non-quest and quest drop in a single group is not recommended. \r\n\r\nNote: The core has a limitation - only 16 non-quest items (money and items added into the loot for quests are not counted for this \"16\") may come into the loot. And this is not a caprice of core devs - the client has some constraints. As most of loots have much more than 16 possible items (sometimes several hundreds) so without groups there is a (little) chance that more than 16 items will be rolled for a given loot but player will be able to see (and take) only first 16 of them. With groups you can ensure that more than 16 items will never drop. If DB pretends to be a quality software it must have loot template definitions which ensure that not more than 16 plain entries and groups are defined for any loot template. This is just a note - such declaration is not issued by UDB developers yet. \r\n\r\nNote: The core has no limitation for number of groups (except 255 by DB field size), but according to the previous note there is no need to use values greater than 16. \r\n'),

An awful example, isn\'t it? Actually no good example for whole template reference repetition is known, but it is quite useful for group references sometimes. \r\n\r\nBe careful. Self references (loot template includes reference to itself) and loop references (loot template A includes reference to entire template B, loot template B includes reference to entire template A) are completely different from internal references. If you make a self-reference like \r\n\r\n<pre>INSERT INTO `creature_loot_template` (`entry`,`item`,`mincountOrRef`) VALUES \n(\'21215\',\'0\',\'-21215\'); </pre>\r\n\r\nthen the core will crash due to stack overflow at first attempt of loot 21215 processing. That is why self references and loop references are strictly forbidden. \r\n\r\nGroup reference\r\nmincountOrRef < 0, group > 0 \r\n\r\nGroup reference asks core to process another loot template (having entry equal to \"-mincountOrRef\") only in the part of one group - with id equal to value of `groupid` field of the reference entry. So this reference may add only none or 1 item into the loot (provided maxcount is equal to 1). \r\n\r\nMeaning of maxcount field value is the same as described in Template reference. \r\n\r\nNote that there is no way to have a reference as a part of a group as such grouped reference would have the same format as reference to group described here. \r\n\r\nThere are two types of group references: \r\n\r\n¦external reference when group reference row has entry different from entry of the referenced group \r\n¦internal reference when group reference row has the same entry as the referenced group. \r\nBasic usage of group references is to avoid repetition of group definitions when several loot sources have common parts of the loot. In this case it is possible: \r\n\r\n¦to define groups with the same contents (items/drop chances) again and again. The simpliest way, but very RAM consumable. \r\n¦to define the group once as a part of one of loot source loot definition and to include group references in loot definitions of the other loot sources instead of repeating group definition. \r\n¦to define the group once as a part of an artificial loot definition (having entry not corresponding to any source) and to include group references in loot definitions for every related loot source. \r\nThe first way is deprecated, both second and third use external references. UDB recommends to use the third way. \r\n\r\nAs references have chance to be processed it is possible to use them effiently for zone or world drop definitions. Those drops often have different chances for different loot sources (low/high skill gameobjects, non-elite/elite creatures etc) while having the same contents of the loot. The recommended way to define such drops is as following: \r\n\r\n¦to set up a group with 100% group chance in an artificial loot template (using equal-chanced entries when possible) \r\n¦to include references to that group into loot definition of every related loot source setting the drop chance for the reference. \r\nSome bosses drop more than one tier item (two or three). Loot statistics looks like the same group is rolled 2 or 3 times and every time an item (possible the same) is chosen. It is simple to define a group for single item, but how to define drop for the second and the third? We can: \r\n\r\n¦repeat group definition 2 (or 3) times with change of group id \r\n¦define the group once and include 1 (or 2) internal references. \r\n¦define the group once as a part of an artificial loot definition and include 2 (or 3) external group references. \r\n¦define the group once as a part of an artificial loot definition and include an external group reference with repetition factor of 2 (or 3). \r\nThe in-game results will be the same. But again - the first way is very inefficient and then deprecated. We recommends to use the forth way. \r\n'),

(498,0,'disenchant_loot_template','groupid','A group is a set of loot definitions.','A group is a set of loot definitions processed in such a way that at any given looting event the loot generated can receive only 1 (or none) item from the items declared in the loot definitions of the group. Groups are formed by loot definitions having the same values of entry and groupid fields. \r\n\r\nA group may consists of explicitly-chanced (having non-zero ChanceOrQuestChance) and equal-chanced (ChanceOrQuestChance = 0) entries. Every equal-chanced entry of a group is considered having such a chance that: \r\n\r\n¦all equal-chanced entries have the same chance \r\n¦group chance (sum of chances of all entries) is 100% \r\nOf course group may consist of \r\n\r\n¦only explicitly-chanced entries or \r\n¦only equal-chanced entries or \r\n¦entries of both type. \r\nThe easies way to understand what are groups is to understand how core processes grouped entries: \r\n\r\nAt loading time: \r\n\r\n¦groups are formed - all grouped entries with the same values of groupid and entry fields are gathered into two sets - one for explicitly-chanced entries and one for equal-chanced. Note that order of entries in the sets can not be defined by DB - you should assume that the entries are in an unknown order. But indeed every time core processes a group the entries are in some order, constant during processing. \r\nDuring loot generation: \r\n\r\n¦core rolls for explicitly-chanced entries (if any): \r\n¦a random number R is rolled in range 0 to 100 (floating point value). \r\n¦chance to drop is checked for every (explicitly-chanced) entry in the group: \r\n¦if R is less than absolute value of ChanceOrQuestChance of the entry then the entry \'wins\': the item is included in the loot. Group processing stops, the rest of group entries are just skipped. \r\n¦otherwise the entry \'looses\': the item misses its chance to get into the loot. R is decreased by the absolute value of ChanceOrQuestChance and next explicitly-chanced entry is checked. \r\n¦if none of explicitly-chanced entries got its chance then equal-chanced part (if any) is processed: \r\n¦a random entry is selected from the set of equal-chanced entries and corresponding item is included in the loot. \r\n¦If nothing selected yet (this never happens if the group has some equal-chanced entries) - no item from the group is included into the loot. \r\nLet us use term group chance as the sum of ChanceOrQuestChance (absolute) values for the group. Please note that even one equal-chanced entry makes group chance to be 100% (provided that sum of explicit chances does not exceed 100%). \r\n\r\nIf you understand the process you can understand the results: \r\n\r\n¦Not more than one item from a group may drop at any given time. \r\n¦If group chance is at least 100 then one item will be dropped for sure. \r\n¦If group chance does not exceed 100 then every item defined in group entries has exactly that chance to drop as set in ChanceOrQuestChance. \r\n¦If group chance is greater than 100 then some entries will lost a part of their chance (or even not be checked at all - that will be the case for all equal-chanced entries) whatever value takes the roll R. So for some items chance to drop will be less than their ChanceOrQuestChance. That is very bad and that is why having group chance > 100 is strictly prohibited. \r\n¦Processing of equal-chanced part takes much less time then of explicitly-chanced one. So usage of equal-chanced groups is recommended when possible. \r\nSo now basic applications of the groups are clear: \r\n\r\n¦Groups with group chance of 100% generate exactly one item every time. This is needed quite often, for example such behavior is needed to define a loot template for tier item drop from a boss. \r\n¦Groups with group chance < 100 generate one or zero items every time keeping chances of every item unchanged. Such behavior is useful to limit maximum number of items in the loot. \r\n¦A single group may be define\nd for a set of items common for several loot sources. This could be very useful for decreasing DB size without any loss of data. See References for more details. \r\nThere is no way to have a reference as a part of a group. \r\n\r\nNote: A group may contain definitions of non-quest drop, quest drop or both, but mixing non-quest and quest drop in a single group is not recommended. \r\n\r\nNote: The core has a limitation - only 16 non-quest items (money and items added into the loot for quests are not counted for this \"16\") may come into the loot. And this is not a caprice of core devs - the client has some constraints. As most of loots have much more than 16 possible items (sometimes several hundreds) so without groups there is a (little) chance that more than 16 items will be rolled for a given loot but player will be able to see (and take) only first 16 of them. With groups you can ensure that more than 16 items will never drop. If DB pretends to be a quality software it must have loot template definitions which ensure that not more than 16 plain entries and groups are defined for any loot template. This is just a note - such declaration is not issued by UDB developers yet. \r\n\r\nNote: The core has no limitation for number of groups (except 255 by DB field size), but according to the previous note there is no need to use values greater than 16. \r\n'),

Groups are formed by loot definitions having the same values of entry and groupid fields. \r\n\r\nA group may consists of explicitly-chanced (having non-zero ChanceOrQuestChance) and equal-chanced (ChanceOrQuestChance = 0) entries. Every equal-chanced entry of a group is considered having such a chance that: \r\n\r\n¦all equal-chanced entries have the same chance \r\n¦group chance (sum of chances of all entries) is 100% \r\nOf course group may consist of \r\n\r\n¦only explicitly-chanced entries or \r\n¦only equal-chanced entries or \r\n¦entries of both type. \r\nThe easies way to understand what are groups is to understand how core processes grouped entries: \r\n\r\nAt loading time: \r\n\r\n¦groups are formed - all grouped entries with the same values of groupid and entry fields are gathered into two sets - one for explicitly-chanced entries and one for equal-chanced. Note that order of entries in the sets can not be defined by DB - you should assume that the entries are in an unknown order. But indeed every time core processes a group the entries are in some order, constant during processing. \r\nDuring loot generation: \r\n\r\n¦core rolls for explicitly-chanced entries (if any): \r\n¦a random number R is rolled in range 0 to 100 (floating point value). \r\n¦chance to drop is checked for every (explicitly-chanced) entry in the group: \r\n¦if R is less than absolute value of ChanceOrQuestChance of the entry then the entry \'wins\': the item is included in the loot. Group processing stops, the rest of group entries are just skipped. \r\n¦otherwise the entry \'looses\': the item misses its chance to get into the loot. R is decreased by the absolute value of ChanceOrQuestChance and next explicitly-chanced entry is checked. \r\n¦if none of explicitly-chanced entries got its chance then equal-chanced part (if any) is processed: \r\n¦a random entry is selected from the set of equal-chanced entries and corresponding item is included in the loot. \r\n¦If nothing selected yet (this never happens if the group has some equal-chanced entries) - no item from the group is included into the loot. \r\nLet us use term group chance as the sum of ChanceOrQuestChance (absolute) values for the group. Please note that even one equal-chanced entry makes group chance to be 100% (provided that sum of explicit chances does not exceed 100%). \r\n\r\nIf you understand the process you can understand the results: \r\n\r\n¦Not more than one item from a group may drop at any given time. \r\n¦If group chance is at least 100 then one item will be dropped for sure. \r\n¦If group chance does not exceed 100 then every item defined in group entries has exactly that chance to drop as set in ChanceOrQuestChance. \r\n¦If group chance is greater than 100 then some entries will lost a part of their chance (or even not be checked at all - that will be the case for all equal-chanced entries) whatever value takes the roll R. So for some items chance to drop will be less than their ChanceOrQuestChance. That is very bad and that is why having group chance > 100 is strictly prohibited. \r\n¦Processing of equal-chanced part takes much less time then of explicitly-chanced one. So usage of equal-chanced groups is recommended when possible. \r\nSo now basic applications of the groups are clear: \r\n\r\n¦Groups with group chance of 100% generate exactly one item every time. This is needed quite often, for example such behavior is needed to define a loot template for tier item drop from a boss. \r\n¦Groups with group chance < 100 generate one or zero items every time keeping chances of every item unchanged. Such behavior is useful to limit maximum number of items in the loot. \r\n¦A single group may be define\nd for a set of items common for several loot sources. This could be very useful for decreasing DB size without any loss of data. See References for more details. \r\nThere is no way to have a reference as a part of a group. \r\n\r\nNote: A group may contain definitions of non-quest drop, quest drop or both, but mixing non-quest and quest drop in a single group is not recommended. \r\n\r\nNote: The core has a limitation - only 16 non-quest items (money and items added into the loot for quests are not counted for this \"16\") may come into the loot. And this is not a caprice of core devs - the client has some constraints. As most of loots have much more than 16 possible items (sometimes several hundreds) so without groups there is a (little) chance that more than 16 items will be rolled for a given loot but player will be able to see (and take) only first 16 of them. With groups you can ensure that more than 16 items will never drop. If DB pretends to be a quality software it must have loot template definitions which ensure that not more than 16 plain entries and groups are defined for any loot template. This is just a note - such declaration is not issued by UDB developers yet. \r\n\r\nNote: The core has no limitation for number of groups (except 255 by DB field size), but according to the previous note there is no need to use values greater than 16. \r\n'),

R is decreased by the absolute value of ChanceOrQuestChance and next explicitly-chanced entry is checked. \r\n¦if none of explicitly-chanced entries got its chance then equal-chanced part (if any) is processed: \r\n¦a random entry is selected from the set of equal-chanced entries and corresponding item is included in the loot. \r\n¦If nothing selected yet (this never happens if the group has some equal-chanced entries) - no item from the group is included into the loot. \r\nLet us use term group chance as the sum of ChanceOrQuestChance (absolute) values for the group. Please note that even one equal-chanced entry makes group chance to be 100% (provided that sum of explicit chances does not exceed 100%). \r\n\r\nIf you understand the process you can understand the results: \r\n\r\n¦Not more than one item from a group may drop at any given time. \r\n¦If group chance is at least 100 then one item will be dropped for sure. \r\n¦If group chance does not exceed 100 then every item defined in group entries has exactly that chance to drop as set in ChanceOrQuestChance. \r\n¦If group chance is greater than 100 then some entries will lost a part of their chance (or even not be checked at all - that will be the case for all equal-chanced entries) whatever value takes the roll R. So for some items chance to drop will be less than their ChanceOrQuestChance. That is very bad and that is why having group chance > 100 is strictly prohibited. \r\n¦Processing of equal-chanced part takes much less time then of explicitly-chanced one. So usage of equal-chanced groups is recommended when possible. \r\nSo now basic applications of the groups are clear: \r\n\r\n¦Groups with group chance of 100% generate exactly one item every time. This is needed quite often, for example such behavior is needed to define a loot template for tier item drop from a boss. \r\n¦Groups with group chance < 100 generate one or zero items every time keeping chances of every item unchanged. Such behavior is useful to limit maximum number of items in the loot. \r\n¦A single group may be define\nd for a set of items common for several loot sources. This could be very useful for decreasing DB size without any loss of data. See References for more details. \r\nThere is no way to have a reference as a part of a group. \r\n\r\nNote: A group may contain definitions of non-quest drop, quest drop or both, but mixing non-quest and quest drop in a single group is not recommended. \r\n\r\nNote: The core has a limitation - only 16 non-quest items (money and items added into the loot for quests are not counted for this \"16\") may come into the loot. And this is not a caprice of core devs - the client has some constraints. As most of loots have much more than 16 possible items (sometimes several hundreds) so without groups there is a (little) chance that more than 16 items will be rolled for a given loot but player will be able to see (and take) only first 16 of them. With groups you can ensure that more than 16 items will never drop. If DB pretends to be a quality software it must have loot template definitions which ensure that not more than 16 plain entries and groups are defined for any loot template. This is just a note - such declaration is not issued by UDB developers yet. \r\n\r\nNote: The core has no limitation for number of groups (except 255 by DB field size), but according to the previous note there is no need to use values greater than 16. \r\n'),

(1092,0,'mail_loot_template','groupid','A group is a set of loot definitions.','A group is a set of loot definitions processed in such a way that at any given looting event the loot generated can receive only 1 (or none) item from the items declared in the loot definitions of the group. Groups are formed by loot definitions having the same values of entry and groupid fields. \r\n\r\nA group may consists of explicitly-chanced (having non-zero ChanceOrQuestChance) and equal-chanced (ChanceOrQuestChance = 0) entries. Every equal-chanced entry of a group is considered having such a chance that: \r\n\r\n¦all equal-chanced entries have the same chance \r\n¦group chance (sum of chances of all entries) is 100% \r\nOf course group may consist of \r\n\r\n¦only explicitly-chanced entries or \r\n¦only equal-chanced entries or \r\n¦entries of both type. \r\nThe easies way to understand what are groups is to understand how core processes grouped entries: \r\n\r\nAt loading time: \r\n\r\n¦groups are formed - all grouped entries with the same values of groupid and entry fields are gathered into two sets - one for explicitly-chanced entries and one for equal-chanced. Note that order of entries in the sets can not be defined by DB - you should assume that the entries are in an unknown order. But indeed every time core processes a group the entries are in some order, constant during processing. \r\nDuring loot generation: \r\n\r\n¦core rolls for explicitly-chanced entries (if any): \r\n¦a random number R is rolled in range 0 to 100 (floating point value). \r\n¦chance to drop is checked for every (explicitly-chanced) entry in the group: \r\n¦if R is less than absolute value of ChanceOrQuestChance of the entry then the entry \'wins\': the item is included in the loot. Group processing stops, the rest of group entries are just skipped. \r\n¦otherwise the entry \'looses\': the item misses its chance to get into the loot. R is decreased by the absolute value of ChanceOrQuestChance and next explicitly-chanced entry is checked. \r\n¦if none of explicitly-chanced entries got its chance then equal-chanced part (if any) is processed: \r\n¦a random entry is selected from the set of equal-chanced entries and corresponding item is included in the loot. \r\n¦If nothing selected yet (this never happens if the group has some equal-chanced entries) - no item from the group is included into the loot. \r\nLet us use term group chance as the sum of ChanceOrQuestChance (absolute) values for the group. Please note that even one equal-chanced entry makes group chance to be 100% (provided that sum of explicit chances does not exceed 100%). \r\n\r\nIf you understand the process you can understand the results: \r\n\r\n¦Not more than one item from a group may drop at any given time. \r\n¦If group chance is at least 100 then one item will be dropped for sure. \r\n¦If group chance does not exceed 100 then every item defined in group entries has exactly that chance to drop as set in ChanceOrQuestChance. \r\n¦If group chance is greater than 100 then some entries will lost a part of their chance (or even not be checked at all - that will be the case for all equal-chanced entries) whatever value takes the roll R. So for some items chance to drop will be less than their ChanceOrQuestChance. That is very bad and that is why having group chance > 100 is strictly prohibited. \r\n¦Processing of equal-chanced part takes much less time then of explicitly-chanced one. So usage of equal-chanced groups is recommended when possible. \r\nSo now basic applications of the groups are clear: \r\n\r\n¦Groups with group chance of 100% generate exactly one item every time. This is needed quite often, for example such behavior is needed to define a loot template for tier item drop from a boss. \r\n¦Groups with group chance < 100 generate one or zero items every time keeping chances of every item unchanged. Such behavior is useful to limit maximum number of items in the loot. \r\n¦A single group may be define\nd for a set of items common for several loot sources. This could be very useful for decreasing DB size without any loss of data. See References for more details. \r\nThere is no way to have a reference as a part of a group. \r\n\r\nNote: A group may contain definitions of non-quest drop, quest drop or both, but mixing non-quest and quest drop in a single group is not recommended. \r\n\r\nNote: The core has a limitation - only 16 non-quest items (money and items added into the loot for quests are not counted for this \"16\") may come into the loot. And this is not a caprice of core devs - the client has some constraints. As most of loots have much more than 16 possible items (sometimes several hundreds) so without groups there is a (little) chance that more than 16 items will be rolled for a given loot but player will be able to see (and take) only first 16 of them. With groups you can ensure that more than 16 items will never drop. If DB pretends to be a quality software it must have loot template definitions which ensure that not more than 16 plain entries and groups are defined for any loot template. This is just a note - such declaration is not issued by UDB developers yet. \r\n\r\nNote: The core has no limitation for number of groups (except 255 by DB field size), but according to the previous note there is no need to use values greater than 16. \r\n'),

(1236,0,'pickpocketing_loot_template','groupid','A group is a set of loot definitions.','A group is a set of loot definitions processed in such a way that at any given looting event the loot generated can receive only 1 (or none) item from the items declared in the loot definitions of the group. Groups are formed by loot definitions having the same values of entry and groupid fields. \r\n\r\nA group may consists of explicitly-chanced (having non-zero ChanceOrQuestChance) and equal-chanced (ChanceOrQuestChance = 0) entries. Every equal-chanced entry of a group is considered having such a chance that: \r\n\r\n¦all equal-chanced entries have the same chance \r\n¦group chance (sum of chances of all entries) is 100% \r\nOf course group may consist of \r\n\r\n¦only explicitly-chanced entries or \r\n¦only equal-chanced entries or \r\n¦entries of both type. \r\nThe easies way to understand what are groups is to understand how core processes grouped entries: \r\n\r\nAt loading time: \r\n\r\n¦groups are formed - all grouped entries with the same values of groupid and entry fields are gathered into two sets - one for explicitly-chanced entries and one for equal-chanced. Note that order of entries in the sets can not be defined by DB - you should assume that the entries are in an unknown order. But indeed every time core processes a group the entries are in some order, constant during processing. \r\nDuring loot generation: \r\n\r\n¦core rolls for explicitly-chanced entries (if any): \r\n¦a random number R is rolled in range 0 to 100 (floating point value). \r\n¦chance to drop is checked for every (explicitly-chanced) entry in the group: \r\n¦if R is less than absolute value of ChanceOrQuestChance of the entry then the entry \'wins\': the item is included in the loot. Group processing stops, the rest of group entries are just skipped. \r\n¦otherwise the entry \'looses\': the item misses its chance to get into the loot. R is decreased by the absolute value of ChanceOrQuestChance and next explicitly-chanced entry is checked. \r\n¦if none of explicitly-chanced entries got its chance then equal-chanced part (if any) is processed: \r\n¦a random entry is selected from the set of equal-chanced entries and corresponding item is included in the loot. \r\n¦If nothing selected yet (this never happens if the group has some equal-chanced entries) - no item from the group is included into the loot. \r\nLet us use term group chance as the sum of ChanceOrQuestChance (absolute) values for the group. Please note that even one equal-chanced entry makes group chance to be 100% (provided that sum of explicit chances does not exceed 100%). \r\n\r\nIf you understand the process you can understand the results: \r\n\r\n¦Not more than one item from a group may drop at any given time. \r\n¦If group chance is at least 100 then one item will be dropped for sure. \r\n¦If group chance does not exceed 100 then every item defined in group entries has exactly that chance to drop as set in ChanceOrQuestChance. \r\n¦If group chance is greater than 100 then some entries will lost a part of their chance (or even not be checked at all - that will be the case for all equal-chanced entries) whatever value takes the roll R. So for some items chance to drop will be less than their ChanceOrQuestChance. That is very bad and that is why having group chance > 100 is strictly prohibited. \r\n¦Processing of equal-chanced part takes much less time then of explicitly-chanced one. So usage of equal-chanced groups is recommended when possible. \r\nSo now basic applications of the groups are clear: \r\n\r\n¦Groups with group chance of 100% generate exactly one item every time. This is needed quite often, for example such behavior is needed to define a loot template for tier item drop from a boss. \r\n¦Groups with group chance < 100 generate one or zero items every time keeping chances of every item unchanged. Such behavior is useful to limit maximum number of items in the loot. \r\n¦A single group may be define\nd for a set of items common for several loot sources. This could be very useful for decreasing DB size without any loss of data. See References for more details. \r\nThere is no way to have a reference as a part of a group. \r\n\r\nNote: A group may contain definitions of non-quest drop, quest drop or both, but mixing non-quest and quest drop in a single group is not recommended. \r\n\r\nNote: The core has a limitation - only 16 non-quest items (money and items added into the loot for quests are not counted for this \"16\") may come into the loot. And this is not a caprice of core devs - the client has some constraints. As most of loots have much more than 16 possible items (sometimes several hundreds) so without groups there is a (little) chance that more than 16 items will be rolled for a given loot but player will be able to see (and take) only first 16 of them. With groups you can ensure that more than 16 items will never drop. If DB pretends to be a quality software it must have loot template definitions which ensure that not more than 16 plain entries and groups are defined for any loot template. This is just a note - such declaration is not issued by UDB developers yet. \r\n\r\nNote: The core has no limitation for number of groups (except 255 by DB field size), but according to the previous note there is no need to use values greater than 16. \r\n'),

Using non-1 repetition factor for other things (references to a group with group chance less than 100% or chanced references with chance less than 100%) must be agreed with UDB devs first (and described here). \r\n\r\nNote: core rolls chance for any loot definition entry just one time - so if a references looses its chance it is skipped for the current loot completely whatever is maxcount value. \r\n'),

Groups are formed by loot definitions having the same values of entry and groupid fields. \r\n\r\nA group may consists of explicitly-chanced (having non-zero ChanceOrQuestChance) and equal-chanced (ChanceOrQuestChance = 0) entries. Every equal-chanced entry of a group is considered having such a chance that: \r\n\r\n¦all equal-chanced entries have the same chance \r\n¦group chance (sum of chances of all entries) is 100% \r\nOf course group may consist of \r\n\r\n¦only explicitly-chanced entries or \r\n¦only equal-chanced entries or \r\n¦entries of both type. \r\nThe easies way to understand what are groups is to understand how core processes grouped entries: \r\n\r\nAt loading time: \r\n\r\n¦groups are formed - all grouped entries with the same values of groupid and entry fields are gathered into two sets - one for explicitly-chanced entries and one for equal-chanced. Note that order of entries in the sets can not be defined by DB - you should assume that the entries are in an unknown order. But indeed every time core processes a group the entries are in some order, constant during processing. \r\nDuring loot generation: \r\n\r\n¦core rolls for explicitly-chanced entries (if any): \r\n¦a random number R is rolled in range 0 to 100 (floating point value). \r\n¦chance to drop is checked for every (explicitly-chanced) entry in the group: \r\n¦if R is less than absolute value of ChanceOrQuestChance of the entry then the entry \'wins\': the item is included in the loot. Group processing stops, the rest of group entries are just skipped. \r\n¦otherwise the entry \'looses\': the item misses its chance to get into the loot. R is decreased by the absolute value of ChanceOrQuestChance and next explicitly-chanced entry is checked. \r\n¦if none of explicitly-chanced entries got its chance then equal-chanced part (if any) is processed: \r\n¦a random entry is selected from the set of equal-chanced entries and corresponding item is included in the loot. \r\n¦If nothing selected yet (this never happens if the group has some equal-chanced entries) - no item from the group is included into the loot. \r\nLet us use term group chance as the sum of ChanceOrQuestChance (absolute) values for the group. Please note that even one equal-chanced entry makes group chance to be 100% (provided that sum of explicit chances does not exceed 100%). \r\n\r\nIf you understand the process you can understand the results: \r\n\r\n¦Not more than one item from a group may drop at any given time. \r\n¦If group chance is at least 100 then one item will be dropped for sure. \r\n¦If group chance does not exceed 100 then every item defined in group entries has exactly that chance to drop as set in ChanceOrQuestChance. \r\n¦If group chance is greater than 100 then some entries will lost a part of their chance (or even not be checked at all - that will be the case for all equal-chanced entries) whatever value takes the roll R. So for some items chance to drop will be less than their ChanceOrQuestChance. That is very bad and that is why having group chance > 100 is strictly prohibited. \r\n¦Processing of equal-chanced part takes much less time then of explicitly-chanced one. So usage of equal-chanced groups is recommended when possible. \r\nSo now basic applications of the groups are clear: \r\n\r\n¦Groups with group chance of 100% generate exactly one item every time. This is needed quite often, for example such behavior is needed to define a loot template for tier item drop from a boss. \r\n¦Groups with group chance < 100 generate one or zero items every time keeping chances of every item unchanged. Such behavior is useful to limit maximum number of items in the loot. \r\n¦A single group may be define\nd for a set of items common for several loot sources. This could be very useful for decreasing DB size without any loss of data. See References for more details. \r\nThere is no way to have a reference as a part of a group. \r\n\r\nNote: A group may contain definitions of non-quest drop, quest drop or both, but mixing non-quest and quest drop in a single group is not recommended. \r\n\r\nNote: The core has a limitation - only 16 non-quest items (money and items added into the loot for quests are not counted for this \"16\") may come into the loot. And this is not a caprice of core devs - the client has some constraints. As most of loots have much more than 16 possible items (sometimes several hundreds) so without groups there is a (little) chance that more than 16 items will be rolled for a given loot but player will be able to see (and take) only first 16 of them. With groups you can ensure that more than 16 items will never drop. If DB pretends to be a quality software it must have loot template definitions which ensure that not more than 16 plain entries and groups are defined for any loot template. This is just a note - such declaration is not issued by UDB developers yet. \r\n\r\nNote: The core has no limitation for number of groups (except 255 by DB field size), but according to the previous note there is no need to use values greater than 16. \r\n'),

(1487,0,'skinning_loot_template','groupid','A group is a set of loot definitions.','A group is a set of loot definitions processed in such a way that at any given looting event the loot generated can receive only 1 (or none) item from the items declared in the loot definitions of the group. Groups are formed by loot definitions having the same values of entry and groupid fields. \r\n\r\nA group may consists of explicitly-chanced (having non-zero ChanceOrQuestChance) and equal-chanced (ChanceOrQuestChance = 0) entries. Every equal-chanced entry of a group is considered having such a chance that: \r\n\r\n¦all equal-chanced entries have the same chance \r\n¦group chance (sum of chances of all entries) is 100% \r\nOf course group may consist of \r\n\r\n¦only explicitly-chanced entries or \r\n¦only equal-chanced entries or \r\n¦entries of both type. \r\nThe easies way to understand what are groups is to understand how core processes grouped entries: \r\n\r\nAt loading time: \r\n\r\n¦groups are formed - all grouped entries with the same values of groupid and entry fields are gathered into two sets - one for explicitly-chanced entries and one for equal-chanced. Note that order of entries in the sets can not be defined by DB - you should assume that the entries are in an unknown order. But indeed every time core processes a group the entries are in some order, constant during processing. \r\nDuring loot generation: \r\n\r\n¦core rolls for explicitly-chanced entries (if any): \r\n¦a random number R is rolled in range 0 to 100 (floating point value). \r\n¦chance to drop is checked for every (explicitly-chanced) entry in the group: \r\n¦if R is less than absolute value of ChanceOrQuestChance of the entry then the entry \'wins\': the item is included in the loot. Group processing stops, the rest of group entries are just skipped. \r\n¦otherwise the entry \'looses\': the item misses its chance to get into the loot. R is decreased by the absolute value of ChanceOrQuestChance and next explicitly-chanced entry is checked. \r\n¦if none of explicitly-chanced entries got its chance then equal-chanced part (if any) is processed: \r\n¦a random entry is selected from the set of equal-chanced entries and corresponding item is included in the loot. \r\n¦If nothing selected yet (this never happens if the group has some equal-chanced entries) - no item from the group is included into the loot. \r\nLet us use term group chance as the sum of ChanceOrQuestChance (absolute) values for the group. Please note that even one equal-chanced entry makes group chance to be 100% (provided that sum of explicit chances does not exceed 100%). \r\n\r\nIf you understand the process you can understand the results: \r\n\r\n¦Not more than one item from a group may drop at any given time. \r\n¦If group chance is at least 100 then one item will be dropped for sure. \r\n¦If group chance does not exceed 100 then every item defined in group entries has exactly that chance to drop as set in ChanceOrQuestChance. \r\n¦If group chance is greater than 100 then some entries will lost a part of their chance (or even not be checked at all - that will be the case for all equal-chanced entries) whatever value takes the roll R. So for some items chance to drop will be less than their ChanceOrQuestChance. That is very bad and that is why having group chance > 100 is strictly prohibited. \r\n¦Processing of equal-chanced part takes much less time then of explicitly-chanced one. So usage of equal-chanced groups is recommended when possible. \r\nSo now basic applications of the groups are clear: \r\n\r\n¦Groups with group chance of 100% generate exactly one item every time. This is needed quite often, for example such behavior is needed to define a loot template for tier item drop from a boss. \r\n¦Groups with group chance < 100 generate one or zero items every time keeping chances of every item unchanged. Such behavior is useful to limit maximum number of items in the loot. \r\n¦A single group may be define\nd for a set of items common for several loot sources. This could be very useful for decreasing DB size without any loss of data. See References for more details. \r\nThere is no way to have a reference as a part of a group. \r\n\r\nNote: A group may contain definitions of non-quest drop, quest drop or both, but mixing non-quest and quest drop in a single group is not recommended. \r\n\r\nNote: The core has a limitation - only 16 non-quest items (money and items added into the loot for quests are not counted for this \"16\") may come into the loot. And this is not a caprice of core devs - the client has some constraints. As most of loots have much more than 16 possible items (sometimes several hundreds) so without groups there is a (little) chance that more than 16 items will be rolled for a given loot but player will be able to see (and take) only first 16 of them. With groups you can ensure that more than 16 items will never drop. If DB pretends to be a quality software it must have loot template definitions which ensure that not more than 16 plain entries and groups are defined for any loot template. This is just a note - such declaration is not issued by UDB developers yet. \r\n\r\nNote: The core has no limitation for number of groups (except 255 by DB field size), but according to the previous note there is no need to use values greater than 16. \r\n'),

Using non-1 repetition factor for other things (references to a group with group chance less than 100% or chanced references with chance less than 100%) must be agreed with UDB devs first (and described here). \r\n\r\nNote: core rolls chance for any loot definition entry just one time - so if a references looses its chance it is skipped for the current loot completely whatever is maxcount value. \r\n'),
